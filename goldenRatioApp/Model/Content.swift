let theory = Content(text: "Mathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio. \n\nIn other words, on subtracting a square of dimension equal to the smaller edge(a) of the image(a+b,a) of the cat, the left shape has the same aspect ratio(a:b).This gives result to a curved like shape as shown below.\n\nSome twentieth-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and Salvador Dalí, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio, believing this to be aesthetically pleasing. These often appear in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio. \n\nBecause φ is the ratio between positive quantities, φ is necessarily positive and can be calculated as a/b = 6180339887 (Aprox).")

let illustration = Content(text: "The below image is a fine illustration of the Golden Ratio, where the aspect ratio is kept constant. This template is used in many sectors to achieve the divine proportion of design.")
